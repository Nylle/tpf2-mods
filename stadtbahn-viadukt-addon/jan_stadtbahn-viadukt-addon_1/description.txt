This one is huuuge: a bigger modular project with easy segments adding.
The plan was to build a whole system within minutes; just like a model train set.
I think, I'm on a good way.

[h1]Eeeeasy Instant Stadtbahn Construction Basic Set BETA[/h1]

[b]HISTORY[/b]
The Berlin Stadtbahn is a four track rail line only for passenger service mostly build on viaduct arches crossing grade free Berlins central districts from east to west (or the other direction^^). 
Northern two tracks for local service, south for regional and long-distance (like Paris-Moscow). The 11.2 km long viaduct opened in 1882 with 731 arches built, in 597 of this arches soon followed a commercial use: from grocerys, restaurants over storages, horse stalls (later car repairs) to cultural usages like theatres and museums it has even an animal shelter. Today 456 arches are still existing, all of them with preservation order. Not only the viaduct works fine, some of the shops from the beginning years are still existing ever since.
During the Berlin Wall (1961 to 1989) all of the S-Bahn tracks connecting Berlin(West) were cut, services were run seperately in both systems; except one S-Bahn line from west over on this central viaduct. And only people from the west were allowed to the border crossing Station Berlin-Friedrichstraße, where as well East German and West Berlin trains ended. And a big border checkpoint inside the station existet. Though the S-Bahn-service in Berlin (West) was still being operated by the East German Reichsbahn till 1980, it was run from 1984 till reunifiction shortly by the Berlin(West) BVG. 
The local tracks on the viaduct got the third rail electrification in 1928, the catenary electrifiaction of the long-distance tracks followed with a restauration of the viaduct from 1993 to 1998.
Since 30 years now usually all trains are running through east to west again. The DB besides some others like LOCOMORE or ODEG runs service. Now the over 1100 trains each day make a nice train [strike]noise[/strike] atmosphere [strike]in my deam living room[/strike] all accross Berlin.

[b]THIS SET COMES WITH[/b]
The first (almost *see below) standalone segments for railway viaduct building in a modular way (most from 8m to 16m heights) with four tracks each with several options for a very high variety and much of possibilities. Easy to combine for your own Berlin-Stadtbahn Feeling![list]
[*] viaduct straight segments
[*] viaduct road depot segment (only 8m height)
[*] viaduct shop segments with plebs magneteers (only 8m + three shops + more to come)
[*] **UPDATE 1.1** viaduct bridge segments (three types of bridges and railings)
[*] **UPDATE 1.11** viaduct switch segments (beta + specialities *see below)
[*] **UPDATE 1.15** viaduct segments as assets (easy curve building as track assets)
[*] **UPDATE 1.2** viaduct station S-Tiergarten (beta) & cargo station viaduct (beta)
[*] **UPDATE 1.22** 10x ELECTRIFIED Berlin tracks WITH INVISIBLE CATENARY! Also now as modules for modular stations *base models made by EISFEUER and Elektronikfreak* TY!
    *Four 3rd rail tracks Schnellbahn old (1880 *90kmph), Schnellbahn new (1920 *180kmph), U-Bahn Stromschine Kleinprofil (1880 *80kmph) and U-Bahn Stromschine Grossprofil (1920 *100kmph) come with the 3rd rail each left and right. Plus two versions without the 3rd rail (old *70 kmph and new *90 kmph) for switches...  maximum slope of 4%, different curve angles (testing). 
[/list]

[b]THIS FEATURES[/b][list]
[*] available from 1882 (road depot & cargo station from 1920)
[*] collision off, so it is free placeble (but has cons)
[*] more or less adjustments (some experimental or for "pro usage")
[*] different segment lengths (I recommend most use 60-100m) & arch widths options
[*] several arch contents (now 10, more will follow) 
[*] two (different!) height adjustments: the viaduct itself and the difference to street level (too complicated?)
[*] usual and Berlin third rail track (with invisible catenary) type options 
[*] some street options
[*] many different LODs (progressing)
[*] english and german language in strings.lua (more can be added in the discussion topic)
[*] 160kmph max (reality 80kmph)
[*] models are still under developement and might change after an update
[/list]

[b]WORK IN PROGRESS[/b][list]
[*] essential problem fixing
[*] station and track assets
[/list]

PLEASE MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS OF EACH SEGMENT BEFORE YOU BUILD!
Once build it is not possible to change the layout of the viaduct, the reason behind is to be able to [b]change the track types with the magic stick seperately and place track assets and signals individually[/b] (exept the switch module)!
Because the tracks and viaduct supposed to be sepperate, collision has to be set off.
Though this way building has many PROS, it has also some CONS (see known issues). The segments have a high variety of combinations and it is also usable as a track helper or bridge builder. Plus it is quick... and most of all it is smart, beautiful, cool and very train geeky. Just like me. :D
Try it out and once you dit it, you might like it... it is rly e-z :)

You'll fild them under [b]"assets" > "Berlin S-Bahn" (the S-Bahn service symbol)[/b]. And the road depot in "road" > "buildings"..
I usually use the height lines first and follow them along with the flatten terrain tool where it should be placed. Just place the first [i]wisely[/i] and keep snapping on as long as you want (or the map size allows). 

Yes, [b][u]only 4 tracks! No lesser or more track version planned.[/u][/b] (Therefore the freely placeble or snapable assets [i]might[/i] also be released.). I'll try to stay most realistic, but also with high usability. I think it is my best mod yet and has high potential to be expanded. Holla me, if you want to be part of the project. So please: what do you think about it or what did you not understand in use it? Please tell us, before some of your thumbs go down quickly (again)... it is not about the things I thought of, it is about the things I did not thought of! Merci.

[b]WHAT ELSE IS PLANNED[/b][list]
[*] other arch colors
[*] original catenarery poles
[*] menu icons, more underpasses, railing types and other details and options
[*] personal customizing arch(es)
[*] more modules with function and details (sound, smoke, [i]maybe[/i] animations)
[*] a lot of ideas to come and yours may now be told to us^^
[/list]

[b]KNOWN "ISSUES"[/b][list]
[*] Unfortunately (except the switch module) the segments cannot be edited once placed(!) because the tracks built with are (intentionally) in the way.
[*] Be careful: when accedentaly a track was demloished no tracks are placeble anymore, so you have to rebuild the whole segment (pro: u can use it the other way: delete the viaduct underneath and use other bridges or assets for your custom bridge!).
[*] When you want to demolish, you have to click five times per segement (for each track and the viaduct)...
[*] The segment length (with tracks) defines also the distance of the catenary poles, so shorter segments set them maybe too close together
[*] The electrification of track side A in the switch module can't be turned off.
