This mod enables the realistic creation of elevated island-platform stations by adding invisible train station modules with submerged road-connections for 8, 10, and 12 meter elevations.

[h1]How to Use[/h1] 
[olist]
    [*]Create a train station on a dam of 8, 10, or 12 meter height (you can use the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2980796229]Move it![/url]).
    [*]Configure your station with platforms, underpasses, and tracks.
    [*]Add [b]Invisible Dam[/b] modules on both sides of your station which will make it appear floating. Adjust the module-height with N and M to match your elevation.
    [*]Now you can add assets to decorate the "floating" station to make it look like on top of a dam. Passengers will be able to use the underpass to exit the station on ground level if you build a road nearby.
[/olist] 

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Three station heights are supported: 8, 10, and 12 meters. Select your height with the keys N and M.
    [*]You can choose between four configurations per module: exit front, exit center, exit rear, no exit.
    [*]The depth of each module automatically adjusts to the number of adjacent modules to allow multi-platform stations or through-tracks. The last module will always keep its dam to allow one-side viadukts.
    [*]The ground face under the station can be painted over with any brush if you hold the shift-key while painting.

[h1]Limitations[/h1]
[list]
    [*]The vanilla underpass-module cuts a hole into the ground for some reason. This hole is visible under the "floating" station and needs to be covered up, e.g. using the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2472240787]Floor Shapes Asset[/url]. [i](I considered adding a floor to the modules, but those would not be paintable, so I decided to leave this problem to you.)[/i]
    [*]The ground around the floating station will be elevated due to the game engine. You have to flatten it yourself by building a road or other terraforming objects. [i](Initially, I extended the terraformed area under the station to flatten the surrounding area but removed it, because otherwise the station could not connect to a normal dam.)[/i] 
    [*]There will be visible gaps between tracks and platforms which need to be covered by assets.
    [*]If you build roads, tracks or another station under the "floating" station by using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2660921894]Build With Collision[/url], you will later not be able to change station-modules due to collision.
